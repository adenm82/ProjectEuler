Some of my Python solutions to Project Euler problems. 

My stats:

  -Level 3 (86 Problems solved) 
  
  -Highest difficulty problem solved: 45% (Problem 225: Tribonacci Non-divisors and Problem 130: Composites with Prime Repunit Property)
  
  -Least solved problem solved: Problem 816: Shortest Distance Among Points(Difficulty: 5%): Solved by 2182 people

(Yes I use Sieve of Eratosthenes for primes now, you should too!)
