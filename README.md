Some of my Python solutions to Project Euler problems. 
My stats:
  -Level 3 (82 Problems solved) 
  -Highest difficulty problem solved: 45% (Problem 225: Tribonacci Non-divisors and Problem 130: Composites with Prime Repunit Property)
  -Least solved problem solved: Problem 348: Sum of a Square and a Cube(25%): Solved by 3308 people

(Yes I use Sieve of Eratosthenes for primes now, you should too!)
